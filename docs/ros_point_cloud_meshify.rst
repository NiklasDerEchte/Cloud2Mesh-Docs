ROSPointCloudMeshify Overview
=============================

The `ROSPointCloudMeshify <https://github.com/NiklasDerEchte/ROSPointCloudMeshify>`_ module handles the following:

- **Receives PointCloud2 data** via `ROS2 <https://github.com/ros2/ros2>`__ topic <points/xyzrgba>, for example, from a `Zivid <https://github.com/zivid/zivid-ros>`__ camera.
- **Processes point clouds** and converts them into meshes using advanced algorithms.
- **Supports multiple meshing techniques**, including:
  - Poisson Surface Reconstruction
  - Greedy Triangulation
  - Fast Organized Triangle Reconstruction

Features
--------

- Real-time meshing of point cloud data.
- Integration with `ROS2 <https://github.com/ros2/ros2>`__ for seamless communication.
- Built with **C++** and relies on the `PointCloud Library <https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl>`__.
